# Library-Management
My first programming project which is written in C++ at the end of my first semester in Noshirvani institute of Technology.
The program uses files to save data but in a newbie way and is written in a procedural way without good use of functions which indicates how much of a beginner I was.
I only put it here for its historical significance for me.
